# pswd-checker-backend


how you run it:

python3 [script.py] *[pass]...

Example running:
   - python3 check_password.py Edlanta30  //checks how many times password 'Edlanta30' has been leaked


after the script runs it displays how many times your password has been hacked

if not hacked, it says it hasn't been hacked and that your safe


Happy coding! :)
